# What's that?
This is a code which I used to get answers for "Advent of Code"

Every question and more about this initative can be found [here](https://adventofcode.com/2022/about)

# How to run it?
Because code is refering to the relative file `input.txt` make sure to run `cargo run` command inside the src folder
